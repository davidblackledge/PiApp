# PiApp
App to help with writing an irrational poem

The rules are:
* Every word must have a length matching the corresponding digit of pi.  
* Length means letters, not punctuation.
* A length of zero is the only way to include a full stop (period, exclamation point, or question mark).
* The title is the digit before the decimal point.
