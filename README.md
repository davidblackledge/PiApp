# PiApp
App to help with writing an irrational poem

The rules are:
* Every word must have a length matching the corresponding digit of pi.  
* Length means letters, not punctuation.
* A length of zero is the only way to include a full stop (period, exclamation point, or question mark). (Yes sometimes you'll have multiple full stops in a row, but that makes sense as "..." "!?" etc.)
* The title is the digit before the decimal point.

Ok, no big surprise, I'm not the first to do something like this... Immediately AFTER writing this I looked up and found:

* etc.
* https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/84d7eh/pi_poetry/ ... two poems but checking them with my app shows some bugs in them - mostly skipped or doubled digits.

Some have different rules (3 as first word, not title, 0 as 10-letters not full stop)... my app currently includes 997 digits, but people have written 40,000 word works using these techniques.
